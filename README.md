## Description
This homework assignment is focused on code refraction.
In this homework I was given starter code (html and css) that properly functioned but was poorly constructed. My task was to change both the HTML and CSS codes to meet the require standards without affecting any appearance or functionality.


### Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## My Process
1. Go through the html code and replace the general div code with more specific semantic code
2. Adjust HTML code in a logical format
3. Go through CSS code and adjust based on newly formatted HTML file
4. Go through CSS code and comment to provide better understanding
5. Consolidate CSS code
6. Adjust CSS code in a logical format
7. Debug code on both files
8. Check and adjust for correct website presentation
9. Check and adjust for correct website functionality
10. Look over code again for possible errors
